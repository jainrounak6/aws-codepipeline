AWS code pipeline sample setup for node js (React webapp) hosting through S3 bucket on.
You need to configure AWS access key and secert key.

In this repo I have setup Github action as well as code pipeline. You do need only one thing to setup.

You can choose github action file for github action or else you can choose buildspec.yml file for code pipeline.
